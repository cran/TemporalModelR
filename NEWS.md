# TemporalModelR 0.2.0

* Initial CRAN submission.

# TemporalModelR 0.3.0

* Fixed bug in plot_model_assessment which caused some plots to not correctly 
render in markdown documents

* Added functionality to generate_absences which now allowes for users to define 
their own absence data, with this function now able to format user defined absence
data to work with all downstream operations

* Fixed bug with spatiotemporal_partition which was outputting the incorrect bounderies
as part of the spatial partition output. Fixed this output to make it more compatible 
with partitioning user defined absences after the fact to corrospond to updates to
generate_absences
